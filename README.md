# Storage Area FIFO Simulation

A simulation of storage areas using FIFO (First In, First Out) principles. This project visualizes and analyzes the occupancy patterns of multiple storage areas with different capacities.

## Features
- Visual simulation of storage areas with animated forklifts
- FIFO-based item management
- Multiple simulation capabilities
- Real-time occupancy tracking
- Exportable animations

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Dependencies listed in requirements.txt
